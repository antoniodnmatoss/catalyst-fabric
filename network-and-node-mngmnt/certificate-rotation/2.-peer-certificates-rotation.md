# 2. Peer certificates rotation

**Note:** After updating a certificate, the node that uses it must be restarted given that certificates can not be replaced in runtime. Once restarted, give Catalyst Blockchain Manager a few seconds and check that a new certificate is being used. If the peer is up-and-running, the certificate has been successfully replaced.

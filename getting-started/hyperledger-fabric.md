# Hyperledger Fabric

### What is Hyperledger Fabric?

Hyperledger Fabric is the largest open-source blockchain project coordinated by the Linux Foundation. It is a time-tested, modular blockchain framework that has become a standard for enterprise blockchain. Designed to produce enterprise-grade applications and industry solutions, the open architecture uses modular components to tackle a wide range of use cases.

An enterprise-grade blockchain protocol, Hyperledger Fabric’s advanced privacy controls allow only the data you wish to reach known network participants. Business processes are governed by smart contracts, which control automated transactions with self-executing code. These tools outline all terms between parties. Code and agreements are held across the distributed, decentralized blockchain network. Transactions are irreversible and traceable, ensuring trust between participants. This empowers more rapid, informed decision-making, saving organizations time and money, and reducing risk

### Benefits of Hyperledger Fabric

#### Permissioned blockchain

Generate decentralized trust with a network of known organizations, avoiding the risk of anonymous participants.

#### Confidentiality of transactions

Disclose the data you want to share in transactions with only the necessary parties.

#### Modular architecture

Tailor the blockchain application network to your specific needs using its modular architecture, rather than relying on general-purpose platforms.

#### Ease of implementation

Program smart contracts in familiar languages that your team already works with, instead of wrestling with new ones.

### Why Catalyst Blockchain Manager supports Hyperledger Fabric

Open-source protocols have their strengths. But they are developed by ad hoc communities of contributors, meaning that no obligated parties are available to resolve issues when they arise for users. With no guarantees, you could find yourself waiting indefinite amounts of time for fixes to technical problems — or even find that no help comes at all. For this reason, open-source tools are simply not suited to the usability, security, and scalability requirements of the enterprise.

Catalyst Blockchain Manager takes the open-source Hyperledger Fabric protocol and transforms it into an enterprise-grade solution. It includes all the tools and support needed for any hurdle an organization might face in building Hyperledger Fabric-based application networks. Years of experience and expertise have been distilled into an easy-to-use, all-in-one solution. Catalyst Blockchain Manager comes with the most advanced set of productivity tools for deploying, managing, and scaling your blockchain network using highly automated processes.
